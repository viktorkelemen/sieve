# Effects

Effects for arps and chord progressions.

## 1. Note Skip / Thin Out
Skip every Nth note or use probability to drop notes.

**Pros:** Creates space, reveals hidden melodies within dense arps, very Barbieri-like
**Cons:** Can lose rhythmic drive if overdone

## 2. Euclidean Distribution
Redistribute notes across euclidean patterns (e.g., 5 notes spread over 8 steps).

**Pros:** Mathematically interesting rhythms, polyrhythmic potential
**Cons:** Can feel mechanical, loses original timing feel

## 3. Octave Scatter
Randomly or periodically shift notes up/down octaves.

**Pros:** Adds range and movement, breaks monotony of single-octave arps
**Cons:** Can sound chaotic, may clash with bass

## 4. Velocity Patterns
Apply accent patterns (e.g., every 4th note louder) or fades.

**Pros:** Adds groove and dynamics, subtle but effective
**Cons:** Depends on synth responding to velocity

## 5. Note Repeat / Ratchet
Repeat certain notes (like a ratchet effect in modular).

**Pros:** Adds tension and energy, classic trance/techno technique
**Cons:** Can get annoying quickly

## 6. Time Stretch / Compress
Speed up or slow down the sequence (halftime, double time).

**Pros:** Easy way to change feel dramatically
**Cons:** Simple, not very "generative"

## 7. Voice Phasing
Offset different voices against each other (Steve Reich style).

**Pros:** Creates evolving polyrhythms, hypnotic, very Barbieri
**Cons:** Needs multi-voice input to be effective

## 8. Note Range Filter
Only play notes within a certain pitch range.

**Pros:** Isolate bass, mids, or highs from chords
**Cons:** Limited creative use

## 9. Probability Gate
Each note has X% chance of playing.

**Pros:** Creates organic variation, never the same twice
**Cons:** Can feel random rather than intentional

## 10. Chord Strum / Humanize
Add small timing offsets to chord notes.

**Pros:** More natural feel, less robotic
**Cons:** Subtle, may not be noticeable

## Top Picks

1. **Note Skip** - essential, core Barbieri technique
2. **Probability Gate** - adds life and variation
3. **Octave Scatter** - opens up the range
4. **Voice Phasing** - if arps have multiple voices
